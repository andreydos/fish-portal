**This project started on Jul 09 2018.**

## Intro

> A GraphQL ready, very opinionated Vue SPA for Vue CLI 3

[This project](https://github.com/frandiox/vue-graphql-enterprise-boilerplate) is based on the [`vue-enterprise-boilerplate` template](https://github.com/chrisvfritz/vue-enterprise-boilerplate) made by [Chris Fritz](https://github.com/chrisvfritz). This repo includes some extra opinionated features such as components inside folders and GraphQL integration with [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/), [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/).

## Features

- [**Thorough documentation**](#documentation): Written with the same care as Vue's core docs to quickly train new team members and consolidate knowledge.
- [**Guaranteed consistency**](linting.md): Opinionated linting for Vue, JavaScript/JSON, SCSS, and Markdown, integrated into Visual Studio Code and run against staged files on pre-commit.
- [**First-class tests**](tests.md): Practice test-driven development with both unit and end-to-end tests. Unit tests with Jest live as first-class citizens alongside your source files, while Cypress provides reliable end-to-end tests in an intuitive GUI for development.
- [**Speedy development**](development.md): Between [configurable generators](development.md#generators), [handy aliases](development.md#aliases), and [global base components](development.md#base-components), your productivity will skyrocket.
- [**GraphQL ready**](backend.md): Integrated with GraphQL and all its features. Some external services are used to speed up development, such as Auth0 and Prisma Cloud.
